            <p> My name is Taras Antoniw. I have been working in the IT field for over 30 years. Mostly in sales and consulting. 
                Working with clients to understand their business and technology requirements. Working with the client 
                to develop effective solutions to meet help them grow their business. </p>
            <p> Until I get a proper picture my avatar is Grumpy Bunny. My boys brought Grumpy Bunny (aka - Arie Maximus Aurelius Goldberg - Arie) home about 5 years ago. 
                He along with his cosnort Daisy a lop bunny have become a playful part of our family.</p>
    
            
            <P> My twin boys are in the last year of high school and are very involved in robotics. They
                are members of two seperate robotics events - First Robotics Competion (FRC) and VEX Robotics. 
                The FRC team is sponsored by thier high school. Last they made it to provicials. 
                They have been more successful with the VEX Robotics competition. In 2017, they made it to worlds and 
                came in second in the Skills Competion. That team disbanded. This year they have started their own team
                with the goal of making to to worlds as a rookie team.</P>
            <p> Other than supporing my boys with the Robotics competitons, my interest are varied. I enjoy: photography,
                    trains - both train spotting and modeling in z-scale and hiking the Bruce Trail, a wonderful resource accessable to all.</p>
            <p> I also am active in the Ukrainian community. Every year for the past 12 years I have organized an event at Centennial Park in Etobicoke
                to celebrate Ukraine's Independence. This event attracts over 10,000 people annually</p>
